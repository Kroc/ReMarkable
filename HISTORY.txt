v.4.5	14.JAN.12
*	Incorrect text-escaping in e-mode regexes caused "$" to break text in table of contents
	(essentially some text was being interpreted as PHP code)

v.4.4	9.FEB.11
*	Applied some changes made by Zegnat: <https://github.com/Zegnat/ReMarkable>
	-	Stop throwing a Notice when no title is specified for a link
	-	Fixes two more Notices that apply to e-mail links
	-	Add support for the HTML5 `hgroup` element (this is paragraph processing, not syntax support)

v.4.3	5.OCT.10
*	Large update to documentation, including how to mix HTML and ReMarkable syntax
*	Changed command line to accept source text from stdin--*will break existing code*--see source for examples
*	Added options parameter for output preferences, this will expand over time
*	Titles allowed on links `<description (/href) "title">`

v.4.2	22.AUG.10
*	Spelling mistake with `<figcaption>`

v.4.1 15.AUG.10
*	Added `{{dfn|definition}}` support

v.4	12.AUG.10
*	Anything allowed in the bookmark portion of hyperlink URLs (this is being abused by more and more sites now)
*	Changed en-dash syntax to “ -to- ” (requires spaces either side) because it was clashing too much with common
	writing like “up-to-date” &c.
*	If a hyperlink is the only thing on a line, it does not get wrapped in a paragraph
	(useful for block images / figures) This is probably not the right thing to do, and a bit specific to camendesign
*	Added image linking `<"alt" thumb.jpg = image.png>`
*	Syntax for HTML5 <figure>
*	Don’t wrongly exit if calling a PHP script from the command line that then includes ReMarkable
*	Do not warn if `$_SERVER['argc']` is not present (thanks Andrew Rowls)
*	Title casing now capitalises correctly after em/en dash
*	DTs now support IDs. Use `:: (#id) …`
*	LIs now support IDs. Use `• (#id)` before the tab character (any bullet type allowed),
	you can now also indent the following lines more to account for an ID bumping the margin to two tabs or more
*	Added “¾” to autocorrection
*	Ellipses converted to unicode “...” => “…”
*	Accented letters Title Casing properly in headings
*	Blank line between DT & DD no longer causes infinite loop
*	Syntax language in pre fence can now contain numbers, e.g. “VB6”

v.3.3	1.NOV.09
*	Default word-wrap changed to 124 to reflect a loss of a character in a Firefox view-source at 1024px wide
*	Removed small as a block, this was too specific to my site and incompatible with RSS readers
*	Small allowed across line breaks `((...))`
*	Citation support for Blockquotes
*	Citation tildes require word boundaries, so you can use ‘~’ on its own e.g “this ~ that”
*	Roman numeral lists “iii.” supported. This has long been documented, but broken
*	Improved bold and italic detection

v.3.2	17.JUN.09
*	Default ``base_path`` changed to `.`
*	Segfault in PHP, memory overflow in the regex for PRE blocks
*	Warnings when PHP ``error_reporting`` switched on
*	Unicode multiplication symbol “×” for “4x4”, “Increased 3x!” or “6ft x 10ft”. Use “<var>x</var>” to avoid
*	New line-break convention supported: ‘space-underscore’ at the end of a line, e.g. “The quick brown fox _”
*	“`...`” now allows double-backtick inside, e.g. “`..``..`” and “````” gives “<samp>``</samp>”
*	“`...`” is now <samp>, and “``...``” for <code>

v.3.1	20.APR.09
*	superscript failing on `“10^th”` as the unicode quotes confusing the regex
*	Hyperlinks / images now support `//` shorthand for `http://`

*	Asterisk bullet points being confused with bold (e.g. “*	*text...*”)
*	Pre-fence syntax has changed to “~~~>” to distinguish opening/closing fence posts in nested fences
*	Slashes being added to apostrophes, e.g. “Don\\\'t”
*	Changed no-follow marker from “!” to “^” because “!” could be a valid relative URL fragment
*	Placeholder tags were being padded 1 extra because “¡” is 2 bytes, not one
*	No longer need to have blank line after a pre-fence inside a pre-fence
*	Placeholder tags were incorrectly being restored (use `array_reverse` instead of `arsort`)
*	Increased list of block-level elements to not wrap with paragraphs

v.2.5	19.JAN.09
*	Spaces or tabs on the first line of text are no longer trimmed (e.g. typographic indent)
*	Automatic generation of a table of contents added, see documentation for details
*	If blank string given, blank string is returned instead of “<p></p>”
*	Headings automatically title-cased

*	Allow pre blocks within lists, definition lists and blockquotes
*	Blockquotes/lists not converting if last thing in document

v.2.2	14.DEC.08
*	Soft-space as newline marker has been removed. Too many problems involved with it being invisible unless your
	text-editor has white-space on and differentiates spaces from soft-spaces. Instead, use the ‘not’ character “`¬`”.
	This is located directly on the keyboard on {PC}s and via Alt+L on Mac.

v.2.1	11.DEC.08
*	Some HTML tidying not working when indent>0

v.2	11.DEC.08
*	Initial Beta release
