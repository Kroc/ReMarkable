v?	
NEW:	Superscript can now be done without a preceeding word, e.g. `^TM`

v0.4.5 (14.JAN.12)

	(essentially some text was being interpreted as PHP code)

v0.4.4 (9.FEB.11)
FIX:	Applied some changes made by Zengnat: <https://github.com/Zegnat/ReMarkable>
	* Stop throwing a Notice when no title is specified for a link
	* Fixes two more Notices that apply to e-mail links

NEW:	Large update to documentation, including how to mix HTML and ReMarkable syntax
FIX:	Changed command line to accept source text from stdin--*will break existing code*--see source for examples

v0.4 (12.AUG.10)
FIX:	Anything allowed in the bookmark portion of hyperlink URLs (this is being abused by more and more sites now)
FIX:	Changed en-dash syntax to “ -to- ” (requires spaces either side) because it was clashing too much with common
	writing like “up-to-date” &c.
FIX:	If a hyperlink is the only thing on a line, it does not get wrapped in a paragraph
	(useful for block images / figures) This is probably not the right thing to do, and a bit specific to camendesign

NEW:	Syntax for HTML5 <figure>
FIX:	Don’t wrongly exit if calling a PHP script from the command line that then includes ReMarkable

NEW:	DTs now support IDs. Use `:: (#id) …`

NEW:	Removed small as a block, this was too specific to my site and incompatible with RSS readers

v0.3.2 (17.JUN.09)
NEW:	Default ``base_path`` changed to `.`
FIX:	Segfault in PHP, memory overflow in the regex for PRE blocks
FIX:	Warnings when PHP ``error_reporting`` switched on
NEW:	Unicode multiplication symbol “×” for “4x4”, “Increased 3x!” or “6ft x 10ft”. Use “<var>x</var>” to avoid
NEW:	New line-break convention supported: ‘space-underscore’ at the end of a line, e.g. “The quick brown fox _”
FIX:	“`...`” now allows double-backtick inside, e.g. “`..``..`” and “````” gives “<samp>``</samp>”
NEW:	“`...`” is now <samp>, and “``...``” for <code>

FIX:	Asterisk bullet points being confused with bold (e.g. “*	*text...*”)
FIX:	Pre-fence syntax has changed to “~~~>” to distinguish opening/closing fence posts in nested fences
FIX:	Slashes being added to apostrophes, e.g. “Don\\\'t”
NEW:	Changed no-follow marker from “!” to “^” because “!” could be a valid relative URL fragment
FIX:	Placeholder tags were being padded 1 extra because “¡” is 2 bytes, not one
NEW:	No longer need to have blank line after a pre-fence inside a pre-fence
FIX:	Placeholder tags were incorrectly being restored (use `array_reverse` instead of `arsort`)

	text-editor has white-space on and differentiates spaces from soft-spaces. Instead, use the ‘not’ character “`¬`”.
	This is located directly on the keyboard on {PC}s and via Alt+L on Mac.
